### Standard Equipment:
 - one large mixing bowl
 - measuring cups
 - spatula
 - one small pot
 - two loaf pans

### Non-standard Equipment: 
 - [Optional] juicer


# Instructions
 - Dissolve the jello packet in 3/4 cup of boiling water. Remove the jello mixture from heat, allowing the mix to cool for 15-20 minutes.
 - Grease and flour the loaf pans.
 - Combine the cake mix, vegetable oil, eggs, and cooled jello mixture. Pour the batter into the greased and floured loaf pans. 
 - Bake at 350 degrees for 40 minutes.
 - Juice the lemons, and mix the juice and icing sugar to create the icing. 
 - When fully baked, allow to cool for approximately 5-10 minutes. Use a knife or slim tool to free the edges, and flip the cakes onto your hand, and then onto a plate.
 - Using several toothpicks, poke holes all over the cake.
 Pour the icing on the cakes, allowing the icing to seep through the holes.

 # Notes
 - There are two brands of lemon cake mix: Betty Crocker, and Duncan Hines. It is unclear which is better at this time.
